## 2.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 3e12c19: Update `@faker-js/faker` dependency to version `9.8.0`

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

Adds support for `zod/v4` and `zod/v4-mini` schemas. Zod 3 schemas are still supported & will continue to be supported as long as they are in the main `zod` package.

The new minimum required version of zod is `zod@3.25.3`.

BREAKING: The `generate` function is no longer public. It caused issues when trying to support both v3 and v4 schemas.

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 9467b9c: Support zod 3.22 and it's new `readonly` schemas

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

### Minor Changes

- bb882d3: Added configuration for extra properties on objects
- bb882d3: Added customization options for `any` and `unknown` data-types

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 78ae17f: Replaced old Generator-based configuration API with fluent-API

  This breaks all existing zocker-setups, including the ones with no custom generators.

  This was done to make zocker more user-friendly going forward, as the new API is signifficantly more intuitive to use, and requires less understanding of zod's internals.

  Consult the README for the new API documentation.

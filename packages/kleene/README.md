# Kleene

Kleene is a utility library for working with Regular Expressions. It's being developed as a companion to [Zocker](https://zocker.sigrist.dev), but can be used outside of it. 

The goal is to be able to merge multiple Regular Expressions into a single one, so that exactly the strings that pass ALL Input regexes match the merged regex.
